# MANDATORY: READ BEFORE ANY ACTION

## STOP - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT COMPLETING THESE STEPS

Before responding to ANY user request, you MUST:
**READ** all files in `8-Agent-Instructions/` folder using `read_file` tool:
   - `instructions/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](instructions/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
   - `instructions/skills.md`](instructions/skills.md)
 **CONFIRM** by stating: `[I read the rules]`

 ## WHY THIS EXISTS

Previous agents ignored passive instructions and made costly mistakes. This is not optional.

Only after completing the above steps may you proceed with the user's request.
